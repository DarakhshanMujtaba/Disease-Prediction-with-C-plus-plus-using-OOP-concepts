# Disease Prediction with C++ using OOP Concepts


## About the Project

Disease Prediction with C++ is a console-based application that utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to predict diseases based on user-provided symptoms. The system includes a Patient class for capturing user information and a Disease class for managing a list of diseases. The Prediction class, inheriting from the Patient class, enables the prediction of diseases based on entered symptoms.

## Features

- **Dynamic Disease List:** Easily add new diseases to the system.
- **User Information Capture:** Capture user details like name, age, and symptoms.
- **Prediction Engine:** Predict diseases based on entered symptoms.
- **Report Generation:** Store and read predicted diseases in a file.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Disease-Prediction-with-C-plus-plus-using-OOP-concepts.git
    cd Disease-Prediction-with-C-plus-plus-using-OOP-concepts
    ```

2. **Compile and Run:**

    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o disease_prediction
    ./disease_prediction
    ```

3. **Follow On-screen Instructions:**

    - Add diseases, display diseases, predict diseases, and read prediction reports.

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
